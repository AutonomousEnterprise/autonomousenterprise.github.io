title: Welcome to Autonomous Enterprise
---
Welcome to _Autonomous Enterprise_ – a new blog at the intersection of business strategy, emerging technology, and the transformative power of Artificial Intelligence. This space is built for business and technology leaders navigating the fast-evolving landscape of enterprise AI. As intelligent agents grow in capability and begin to reshape how value is created, operated, and delivered across industries, the goal of this blog is to serve as your strategic guide through the era of the agentic enterprise.

Every week, you will find new articles with in-depth insights, curated trends, practical strategy frameworks, executive-level analyses, and commentary on how technology breakthroughs drive value for the business. This blog will bring clarity to what is happening now – and what is coming next – through a strategic lens tailored to C-suite decision-makers, technology executives, and transformation leaders.

Over the next year, some of the topics I will be covering include:

*   How to structure your enterprise for autonomous AI-driven value chains
    
*   Strategy frameworks for implementing agentic AI in business functions
    
*   The rise of AI-native operating models and implications for CIOs and COOs
    
*   Business transformation playbooks for deploying intelligent agents at scale
    
*   Real-world case studies of enterprise AI success and failure
    
*   Navigating the ethics, governance, and risk in AI-led organizations
    
*   The shifting role of leadership in a post-human decision-making environment
    

If these themes align with your strategic interests, I invite you to subscribe to the blog’s [RSS feed](https://autonomousenterprise.github.io/feed.xml) to receive the latest articles directly.

A little about me – I am Dimitrije Jankovic, the author behind _Autonomous Enterprise_. I spent over two decades of my career at the intersection of business, technology, and innovation. I have served as a senior technology and product strategy executive, advising CIOs and CTOs at firms across North America. More recently, my focus has been on researching and building Artificial Intelligence technology and autonomous agent systems. I hold an MBA degree from the Rotman School of Management at the University of Toronto and a computer engineering degree from University of Belgrade in Serbia.

This blog is both a platform to share what I have learned – and a space to explore the unknowns ahead. My hope is that it will provoke thought, inspire action, and help leaders like you prepare for what I believe is the most significant reinvention of enterprise value creation in a generation.
