In 2023, Microsoft quietly redefined the purpose of its internal IT organization by transforming it into “Microsoft Digital.” Instead of continuing as a centralized service provider responding to business requests, the unit became an AI orchestrator that enabled the entire enterprise to embed AI into its day-to-day operations. The shift was not merely technological but structural: Microsoft Digital built an internal copilot platform that empowered business units to configure AI agents within guardrails of governance and compliance. The outcome was striking. Business teams gained new autonomy, repetitive tasks were automated, decision-making accelerated, and innovation cycles shortened. This case illustrates a broader truth for the future of business: IT organizations must evolve from service providers into orchestrators of intelligent, agentic systems to realize the vision of the Autonomous Enterprise.

## Traditional IT is a Service Provider

For decades, IT has been strategically positioned as a service provider to the enterprise. This role was anchored in the principle of centralization: IT departments were charged with building, maintaining, and securing the core infrastructure that enabled business operations. The organization’s success was typically measured by uptime, cost efficiency, and service-level agreements. In this model, IT was not expected to lead innovation but to support it indirectly by ensuring the “lights stayed on.”

The service-provider model brought with it certain defining characteristics. IT departments developed highly standardized processes to manage demand, often mediated through ticketing systems and approval workflows. Business units submitted requests, and IT responded, sometimes after long queues and complex prioritization cycles. The focus was primarily on cost containment, operational stability, and risk management. This framework fit a world where IT was expensive, scarce, and needed to be tightly controlled to prevent duplication or security failures.

While this model provided efficiency in an earlier era, it increasingly hinders effectiveness in the emerging landscape of the Autonomous Enterprise. The rigid division between IT and business users creates a bottleneck that slows down innovation. Business leaders, accustomed to rapid experimentation in the age of cloud and SaaS, often find traditional IT unresponsive. The service-provider paradigm inadvertently positions IT as a barrier rather than an enabler, forcing business units to seek shadow IT solutions outside official governance channels.

Most critically, the service-provider mindset is misaligned with the promise and the reality of agentic generative artificial intelligence. AI thrives on decentralization, real-time data, and contextual adaptability. In an enterprise where AI copilots and autonomous agents can be embedded directly into workflows, waiting weeks or months for IT approval undermines the very value proposition of AI. If IT continues to function primarily as a service provider, it risks being bypassed, relegated to a custodial role while business value creation migrates elsewhere.

## New IT is an AI Orchestrator

The emergence of the Autonomous Enterprise demands a fundamental rethinking of IT’s role. The new IT is no longer defined by its ability to provide standardized services but by its ability to orchestrate AI capabilities across the enterprise. The operating model shifts from centralized control to federated enablement, from rigid workflows to composable AI-driven processes, and from cost containment to value orchestration.

The shift in IT’s operating model is profound. Traditional IT functions are organized around centralized control: provisioning infrastructure, approving software, and managing change requests. In the AI orchestrator model, IT becomes the architect of an ecosystem where business units have greater autonomy to deploy and manage AI agents within governance boundaries. Instead of executing business requests, IT equips teams with platforms, APIs, and orchestration layers that allow them to self-serve. Governance becomes less about restricting access and more about enabling safe experimentation and interoperability. This federated structure reflects the reality that AI cannot be scaled effectively through a single centralized bottleneck; instead, it requires distributed ownership with IT providing the connective tissue.

Business processes evolve in parallel. Rigid, predefined workflows give way to adaptive, AI-driven processes that can respond to real-time data and shifting contexts. AI agents increasingly serve as a digital workforce, handling routine decision-making, approvals, exception management, and reporting. Processes become composable, enabling organizations to plug in AI-driven microservices that can be swapped or updated as business needs change. For example, in supply chain management, AI copilots can optimize inventory levels by continuously analyzing demand signals and supplier performance, while in finance, autonomous agents can manage compliance checks and risk assessments in real time. This shift does not just improve efficiency. It creates a level of agility that allows the enterprise to adapt dynamically, an essential capability in volatile markets.

The people dimension is equally transformative. IT teams are no longer defined solely by deep technical expertise in infrastructure or applications but by fluency in AI orchestration. Routine IT tasks such as system monitoring, ticket resolution, and patch management will increasingly be automated by AI operations platforms, reducing the need for large first- and second-line support teams. Instead, demand will grow for roles focused on AI governance, ethics, security, and orchestration. Developers will be augmented by AI coding assistants that accelerate software creation, testing, and maintenance. On the business side, employees will require new skills in configuring and supervising AI workflows, creating a need for what might be called “citizen AI developers.” The future IT organization is thus not a silo of technologists but a partnership between AI-literate business users and AI-empowered IT professionals.

Technology modernization underpins this transformation. Traditional enterprise stacks were designed for transactional systems and batch processing, but the Autonomous Enterprise requires real-time AI workloads and agentic systems capable of acting autonomously within defined guardrails. This necessitates the adoption of AI-first architectures that integrate foundation models through secure APIs, supported by hybrid cloud and edge infrastructures optimized for inference. An enterprise-wide AI data fabric becomes critical, ensuring that agents have access to contextual, real-time information without compromising on security or compliance. Equally important is AI risk management. Systems must be capable of detecting bias, ensuring explainability, and complying with evolving regulations. In this environment, IT’s role shifts from managing servers to orchestrating an ecosystem of data, models, and compute that powers intelligent autonomy at scale.

The value creation potential of the AI orchestrator model of IT is significant. Efficiency gains arise as AI automates repetitive decision-making and optimizes operations, freeing human talent for higher-value tasks. Innovation accelerates as business units can experiment with AI agents within a governed framework, shortening time-to-market for new products and services. Decision-making improves as AI enhances forecasting, scenario modeling, and risk assessment, providing executives with richer insights. Revenue opportunities expand as AI enables hyper-personalized customer engagement, dynamic pricing, and predictive service delivery. Most importantly, the enterprise becomes more agile, with AI-driven workflows that adapt in real time to external shocks or shifting market dynamics.

The transformation is not without challenges. IT leaders must balance empowerment with governance, ensuring that AI is deployed responsibly and does not fragment into uncontrolled silos. Upskilling the workforce, modernizing infrastructure, and establishing new governance models require sustained investment. Yet the alternative, remaining in a service-provider role while AI-driven value creation happens outside IT’s purview, is far riskier. By embracing the orchestrator role, IT not only secures its relevance but positions itself at the center of enterprise value creation in the age of AI.

## Guidance for CIOs

The central message for CIOs is clear: the role and strategic priorities of the IT organization must be reconceived if the enterprise is to realize the full potential of agentic generative AI. This requires a deliberate shift in mindset, operating model, and technology strategy. CIOs should prepare by investing in decentralized AI platforms that empower business units, establishing governance frameworks that ensure safe and compliant AI use, and prioritizing the upskilling of both IT and business teams in AI fluency. The organizations that succeed will not be those with the largest IT budgets or the most centralized control, but those that can orchestrate AI across the enterprise to unlock new forms of efficiency, agility, and innovation. In the world of the Autonomous Enterprise, IT is no longer a service provider. It is the conductor of a symphony of intelligent agents creating value in real time.
